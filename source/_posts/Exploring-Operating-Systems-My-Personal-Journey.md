As a full-time programmer working primarily on web development, I've always been curious about optimizing my workflow through different tools—including operating systems. I often work with technologies like **Laravel**, **JavaScript**, and **React**, and use supporting tools like **VS Code**, **Kitty**, **Docker**/**Podman**, **database clients**, and v**ersion control systems** like **Git**.

Because I spend most of my day in front of a computer, the choice of OS plays a huge role in how comfortable and efficient I can be. Over the years, I’ve explored various operating systems—**Windows**, **macOS**, and multiple **Linux distributions** like **Fedora**, **Ubuntu**, and **Linux Mint**—to find the best fit for my development needs and personal preferences.

Here’s my journey and what I’ve learned along the way:

## Windows: The Jack of All Trades

Most machines come with Windows pre-installed. It's a solid system with wide support and a vast library of software. For better or worse, many of us grew up using it.

### Pros:

- Compatible with almost all hardware.

- Excellent software availability, including mainstream apps and games.

- Familiar interface, especially for general users.

### Cons:

- Genuine licenses can be pricey, which sometimes leads people to use cracked versions—something we know is wrong but occasionally do due to circumstances.

- Because it tries to support so many configurations, performance can be inconsistent.

- Debugging and automation can be limited due to its weaker command-line experience compared to Unix-based systems.

### Additional Thoughts:

Windows also comes with a legacy of ups and downs that many users remember well. Who could forget the legendary **Windows XP**, a system that just worked and felt solid for years? Then came **Windows 7**, which refined the experience and became a new favorite. However, **Windows 8** was a low point—confusing UI changes and poor reception made it an awkward generation. Thankfully, **Windows 10** brought stability and familiarity back, regaining much of **Windows 7**’s glory. Now we’re in the era of **Windows 11**, which feels more like a “forced evolution”—you may not love it, but you’ll probably end up using it anyway.

## macOS: Elegant and Efficient

macOS was almost perfect for my workflow. It runs smoothly, offers consistent software updates, and provides a clean, intuitive user interface. The gestures are incredibly useful, making multitasking and navigation feel effortless.

### Pros:

- Polished and consistent user experience.

- Long-term and reliable system updates.

- Excellent gesture support and integration with Apple’s ecosystem.

- Unix-based terminal, great for developers.

### Cons:

- The hardware is expensive, which sometimes leads to unexpected behavior. For instance, during presentations, I’ve found myself overly cautious—especially when someone, like a superior, tries to point at something on my screen. I get nervous and often have to (politely) stop them because I don’t want them touching the fragile display.

- Newer models are barely serviceable. Even storage and memory upgrades are no longer possible.

- Replacement parts and repairs are costly.

## Linux: The Power of Freedom

Linux has become my current daily driver. After trying many distros, I’ve settled on Fedora as my favorite. Linux gives me full control over my system. While it requires more hands-on configuration, that’s actually one of the things I enjoy.

### Pros:

- Free and open-source.

- Highly customizable to suit any kind of workflow.

- A wide range of distros for different needs: Ubuntu for beginners, Arch for advanced users, Fedora for a good balance between cutting-edge and stability.

- Lightweight and efficient—great for both older and newer hardware.

- Excellent for development work with strong command-line tools and scripting support.

### Cons:

- Some mainstream software (e.g., Adobe products, full-featured Microsoft Office) aren’t natively supported.

- Steeper learning curve for beginners.

- Some hardware, like printers or proprietary components, may require manual configuration.

### Additional Thoughts:

Switching to Linux also gave me peace of mind from a hardware perspective. I now use a ThinkPad laptop, which is relatively affordable yet meets military-grade standards. This makes me feel much more secure. For example, when I used a MacBook, I was always anxious during rain because I had to put it inside my motorbike’s box—worried the screen might get damaged. Now with my current laptop, I trust its durability much more and can carry it around without second thoughts.

## Conclusion

Each operating system has its own strengths and is best suited for different kinds of users:

- **Windows** is great for casual users, students, and gamers.

- **macOS** is ideal for professionals who value design, stability, and smooth workflow.

- **Linux** is the best choice for those who love flexibility, efficiency, and control.

Currently, Linux (specifically Fedora) fits my needs the best as a programmer. That said, I genuinely appreciate what each OS has to offer. Every system has played a unique role in shaping my journey, and I believe there's no single "best" OS—only the one that suits you the most.
